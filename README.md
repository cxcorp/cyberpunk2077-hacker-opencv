`v5_single_hey_it_works.py` takes a screenshot of the Cyberpunk 2077 breach protocol hacking minigame in any native game resolution (except for 21:9, haven't tested it) and outputs the code matrix tiles as individually named images. 
See `dropzone/in/20201222193323_1.jpg` for sample input and `dropzone/tiles` to see what it pumps out.
